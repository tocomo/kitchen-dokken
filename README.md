Overview
========

This test-kitchen plugin provides a driver, transport, and provisioner
for rapid cookbook testing and container development using Docker and Chef.

Usage
=====
Add the following to your ~/.bash_profile
```bash
export KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen.yml
export KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=.kitchen.dokken.yml
```

- Behold `.kitchen.yml`

```bash
 cat .kitchen.yml
```

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: dokken
  chef_version: latest

transport:
  name: dokken

provisioner:
  name: dokken

verifier:
  name: inspec

platforms:
- name: centos-7
  driver:
    image: dokken/centos-7

suites:
  - name: default
    run_list:
    - recipe[hello_dokken::default]
```

How it works

### Primordial State
- List kitchen suites

```

### Create phase
```
laptop:~/src/chef-cookbooks/hello_dokken$ kitchen create
-----> Starting Kitchen (v1.15.0)
-----> Creating <default-centos-7>...
       Creating local sandbox at /Users/someara/.dokken/sandbox/6e1b03ab46-default-centos-7
       Building work image..
       Finished creating <default-centos-7> (0m21.04s).
-----> Kitchen is finished. (0m21.95s)


```

The `kitchen create` phase of the kitchen run pulls (if missing)
the `chef/chef` image from the Docker hub, then creates a volume
container named `chef-<version>`. This makes `/opt/chef` available for
mounting by other containers.

When talking to a local Docker host (over a socket), The driver
creates and bind mounts a sandbox directory to `/opt/kitchen`. This
prevents us from having to "upload" the test data.

When talking to a *remote* Docker host (tcp://somewhere.else), dokken
starts a container named `<suite-name>-data`. It makes `/opt/kitchen` and
`/opt/verifier` available for mounting by the runner. The data
container is the "trick" to the whole thing. It comes with rsync, runs
an openssh daemon, and uses an insecure, authorized_key ala
Vagrant. This is later used to upload cookbook test data.

The venerable `/tmp` directory is avoided, due to the popularity of
`tmpfs` clobbering by inits.

Finally, the driver pulls the image specified by the suite's platform
section and creates a runner container named
`<unique_prefix>-<suitename>`. This container bind-mounts the volumes
from `chef-<version>` and `<suite-name>-data`, giving access to Chef
and the test data. By default, the `pid_one_command` of the runner
container is a script that sleeps in a loop, letting us `exec` our
provisioner in the next phase. It can be overridden with init systems
like Upstart and systemd, for testing recipes with service resources
as needed.

The `kitchen-converge` phase of the kitchen run uses the provisioner
to upload cookbooks through the data container, then execs
`chef-client` in the runner container. It does NOT install Chef, as it
is has already mounted by the driver. The transport then commits the
runner container, creating an image that only contains the changes
made by Chef.

Advanced Configuration
======================

Due to the nature of Docker, a handful of considerations need to be addressed.

A complete example of a non-trivial `kitchen.yml` is found in the `docker` cookbook, at
https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/docker/blob/master/kitchen.yml

### Minimalist images
The Distros (debian, centos, etc) will typically manage an official image on the
Docker Hub. They are really pushing the boundaries of minimalist images, well
beyond what is typically laid to disk as part of a "base installation".

Very often, an image will come with a package manager, GNU coreutils, and
that's about it. This can differ greatly from what is found in typical Vagrant
and IaaS images.

Because of this, it is often necessary to "cheat" and install prerequisites
into the image before running Chef, Serverspec, or your own programs.

To help with this, the Dokken driver provides an `intermediate_instructions`
directive. Here is an example from `httpd`

```yaml
platforms:
- name: debian-7
  driver:
    image: debian:7
    intermediate_instructions:
      - RUN /usr/bin/apt-get update
      - RUN /usr/bin/apt-get install -y apt-transport-https net-tools
```

If present, an intermediate image is built, using a Dockerfile rendered from lines
provided. Any valid instruction will work, including `MAINTAINER`,
`ENTRYPOINT`, `VOLUMES`, etc. Knowledge of Docker is assumed.

This should be used as little as possible.

### Process orientation

Docker containers are process oriented rather than machine oriented. This makes life
interesting when testing things not necessarily destined to run in Docker. Specifically,
Chef recipes that utilize the `service` resource present a problem. To overcome this,
we run the container in a way that mimics a machine.

As mentioned previously, we use an infinite loop to keep the container process from exiting.
This allows us to do multiple `kitchen converge` and `kitchen login` operations without
needing to commit a layer and start a new container. This is fine until we need to start
testing recipes that use the `service` resource.

The default `pid_one_command` is `'sh -c "trap exit 0 SIGTERM; while :; do sleep 1; done"'`

If you need to use the service resource to drive Upstart or systemd, you'll need to
specify the path to init. Here are more examples from `httpd`

- systemd for RHEL-7 based platforms
```yaml
platforms:
- name: centos-7
  driver:
    image: centos:7
    privileged: true
    pid_one_command: /usr/lib/systemd/systemd
    volumes:
      - /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro # required by systemd

```

You can combine `intermediate_instructions` and `pid_one_command` as needed.

- Upstart for Ubuntu 12.04
```yaml
- name: ubuntu-12.04
  driver:
    image: ubuntu-upstart:12.04
    pid_one_command: /sbin/init
    intermediate_instructions:
      - RUN /usr/bin/apt-get update
      - RUN /usr/bin/apt-get install apt-transport-https
```

### Caching Downloaded Files

On Debian/Ubuntu systems, all files downloaded via it's package manager (`apt`) are stored at `/var/cache/apt/archives/`.
Therefore one may save the downloads on a different volume and therefore save time. One may even use one's own apt cache folder to save even more time.

On some versions of Ubuntu (16.04 at least), the container deletes all the downloads uppon every run of `apt-get update`, so that must be disabled

- `apt` Caching on Ubuntu 16.04
```yaml
---
driver:
  name: dokken
  volumes:
  # saves the apt archieves outside of the container
  - /var/cache/apt/archives/:/var/cache/apt/archives/

platforms:
- name: ubuntu-16.04
  driver:
    image: dokken/ubuntu-16.04
    pid_one_command: /bin/systemd
    intermediate_instructions:
      # prevent APT from deleting the APT folder
      - RUN rm /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/docker-clean
```

Using dokken-images
===================
While the `intermediate_instructions` directive is a fine hack around the
minimalist image issue, it remains exactly that: A hack. If you
work on a lot of cookbooks you will find yourself copying around
boilerplate to get things working. Also, it's slow. Running
`apt-get update` and
[installing iproute2](https://github.com/someara/dokken-images/pull/13/files)
all the time is a huge bummer.

To solve this, we maintain the
[dokken-images](https://github.com/someara/dokken-images) collection
of fat images that you can find pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dokken/). The package list aims to make sure things like ohai
function in a reasonable way and doing a `kitchen login` yields a
useful environment for debugging. They're hosted on the Docker cloud
and are rebuilt every day to keep the package metadata fresh.

To use them, simply prefix a distro with "dokken/" in the `image`
name. Unfortunately you'll still have to specify `pid_one_command` (for
the time being).

```yaml
- name: ubuntu-16.04
  driver:
    image: dokken/ubuntu-16.04
    pid_one_command: /bin/systemd
  run_list:
  - recipe[whatever::recipe]
```

### Tmpfs on /tmp

When starting a container with an init system, it will often mount a tmpfs into `/tmp`.
When this happens, it is necessary to specify a `root_path` for the verifier if using
traditional Bats or Serverspec. This is due to Docker bind mounting the kitchen data
before running init. This is not necessary when using Inspec.

```yaml
verifier:
  root_path: '/opt/verifier'
  sudo: false
```

Install Chef from current channel
=================================

Chef publishes all functioning builds to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/chef/chef/tags),
including those from the "current" channel. If you wish to use pre-release versions of Chef, set
your `chef_version` value to "current". If you need to test older versions of `chef-client` that are not available on docker hub as `chef/chef`, you can overwrite `chef_image` under the [driver context](https://github.com/someara/kitchen-dokken/blob/2.5.1/lib/kitchen/driver/dokken.rb#L40) to a custom image name such as `someara/chef`.

Chef options
============

It is possible to pass several extra configs to configure the chef binary and options, for example
 to use older versions that do not have the "-z" switch or to get some debug logging.

```yaml
provisioner:
  chef_binary: /opt/chef/bin/chef-solo
  chef_options: ""
  chef_log_level: debug
  chef_output_format: minimal
```

Disable pulling platform images
===============================

To test a locally built image without pulling it first, one can disable
pulling of platform images, which will avoid pulling images that already
exist locally.

```yaml
driver:
  name: dokken
  pull_platform_image: false
```

Testing without Chef
====================

Containers that supply a no-op binary which returns a successful exit status can
be tested without requiring Chef to actually converge.

```yaml
verifier:
  name: inspec

platforms:
  - name: alpine
    driver:
      image: alpine:latest
    provisioner:
      chef_binary: /bin/true
```

FAQ
===

### What about kitchen-docker?
We already had a thing that drives Docker, why did you make this instead of modifying that?

The current `kitchen-docker` driver ends up baking SSH, Chef, and the kitchen data
into the image. This does not. To make this work, I had to create a Driver, a Transport,
and a Provisioner that blur the traditional duties of each. The current Docker driver
can be used with Puppet, Ansible, CFEngine provisioners. This (for the time being) requires
Chef.

See ["Kitchen-Docker or Kitchen-Dokken? Using Test Kitchen and Docker for fast cookbook testing"](https://blog.chef.io/2018/03/06/kitchen-docker-or-kitchen-dokken-using-test-kitchen-and-docker-for-fast-cookbook-testing/) for a more detailed comparison.

### How can I use kitchen to automatically test and publish containers?

Right now there is no `kitchen publish` mechanism. [See this issue](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/issues/329).

You can, however, do it manually.

```
cd my_cookbook ;
kitchen verify suite_name
docker stop suite_name
docker tag suite_name:latest my.computers.biz:5043/something/whatever
docker push my.computers.biz:5043/something/whatever
kitchen destroy
```
